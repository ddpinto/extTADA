# extTADA combines de novo mutations and case/control (transmitted/untransmitted) variants to:

1. Infer genetic parameters of these combined data sets.

2. Identify the number of significant genes based on the genetic parameters.

3. Predict number of significant genes based on a threshold using known genetic parameters (mainly from the tested data sets).

## Requirement

These packages have to be installed:

1. *rstan*: [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/index.html](./https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/index.html)

2. *locfit* [https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/locfit/index.html](./https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/locfit/index.html)

## extTADA can also be used for only de novo data OR only case/control (transmitted/untransmitted) data.
