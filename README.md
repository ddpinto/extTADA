# extTADA combines de novo mutations and case/control (transmitted/untransmitted) variants to:

1. Infer genetic parameters of these combined data sets.

2. Identify the number of significant genes based on the genetic parameters.

3. Predict number of significant genes based on a threshold using known genetic parameters (mainly from the tested data sets).

# extTADA can also be used:

1. For only de novo data OR only case/control (transmitted/untransmitted) data.

2. For multiple-population data.
