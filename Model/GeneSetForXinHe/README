We are using MCMC to estimate all parameters simultaneously, using this model:



Missense damaging variants = missense variants + reported by 7 different methods

We are testing on these:

lof_maf001	damaging_maf001
lof_Singleton	missense_Singleton
lof_Singleton_noexac	missense_Singleton_noexac
lof_maf001	missense_maf001
lof_maf001_noexac	missense_maf001_noexac
disruptive_Singleton_broad	damaging_Singleton_broad
disruptive_Singleton_broad_noexac	damaging_Singleton_broad_noexac


We intersected gene lists with other gene sets by:

1) Choose genes with FDR < 0.3

2) Choose top 100 genes from TADA results
