There are two types of models *internal model* and *external model*.

I have got some problems with Maths Equations in Markdown here, so just go back the sides to better understand the model.

Test MCMC on simulated data, and compare with the Method of Moments of original TADA: [test_simulated_data.ipynb](./test_simulated_data.ipynb)

To see the overlapping genes between extTADA results and other gene sets, go to [intersect_between_309gene_fromTADA_and_other_gene_set.ipynb](./intersect_between_309gene_fromTADA_and_other_gene_set.ipynb)
